      <h1> Kais Bikeshop </h1>
      
      <p> From passion to profession - although as a designer I had originally dedicated myself to fashion, I founded Studio Brisant in 2009. Fast and beautiful bikes have always been a part of my life. With clear roots in design, I saw my "first racing bike" from the very beginning as more than just the pure object that can take me from A to B. Design, colour style, idealism - and never satisfied with the ordinary - expression, quality, hip trends and hard work - parallels to the fashion world can always be found.

        As a fan of retro and vintage, it is only natural to take on the old steel frame: Through craftsmanship and a lot of experience, unique classics have been created, which create a visual impression through their incomparable expressiveness and elegance - strikingly beautiful and eye-catching!
        
        Singlespeed is in demand, especially among young people - the original idea came from the racy courier drivers of New York, who race through the urban jungle with wheels that are as light and fast as possible - in the big cities of Europe this idea has become a trend - e.g. in Hamburg, Berlin, London, Zurich - and also in Münster!
        
        However, my singlespeeds are not to be understood as fixies, i.e. with a fixed gear and without brakes. 
        
        When selecting the colours and components, great importance is attached to colour matching. The originality of the wheel should be preserved. My goal is to create an unmistakable overall picture that always bears an individual signature.  
        
        "The devil is in the detail" - all rarities are completely disassembled into their individual parts down to the last bearing shell and are cleaned and polished in a complex way. All bearings are checked for wear and tear and are relubricated and adjusted with "white Teflon grease". A "butter-soft" run, especially with high-quality components is guaranteed".  
        
        A good frame and high-quality components make for an agile, fast road bike or single speed. We are happy to consider your needs and adapt your dream bike to your wishes. Individual service is important to us so that you can constantly increase your riding pleasure. 
        
        After the elaborate restorations, unique collector's items are created with which you will create a lot of attention and pleasure.
